# Bernard

> Bernard of Chartres used to compare us to dwarfs perched on the shoulders of giants. He pointed out that we see more and farther than our predecessors, not because we have keener vision or greater height, but because we are lifted up and borne aloft on their gigantic stature. [John of Salisbury (1159). Metalogicon. folio 217 recto (f 217r).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants#cite_note-9)
